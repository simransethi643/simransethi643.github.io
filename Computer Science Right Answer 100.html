  <h1>The correct answer is 12</h1>
  <p>In order to calculate the decimal number for 1100, you need to list the power of two from right to left below each digit of the binary number. In this case, below the 0 in the one's place, you would write 2^0 which equals 1. In the tens place, write 2^1 which equals 2. In the hundreds place, write 2^2 which equals 4. In the thousands place, write 2^3 which equals 8. Multiply each power of two by the digit that it is under. In this case, 1*0 = 0, 2*0 = 0, 4*1 = 4, 8*1 = 8. Then add all the resulting values which means 0 + 0 + 4 + 8 = 12. The decimal number for 1100 equals 12.</p>
